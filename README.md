# LightItUP!

## Welcome to **LightItUP!**
- a UP Diliman-led crowdsourced campus visibility app that helps students report lighting conditions and find safer walking paths at night. For optimal functionality, only users with a @up.edu.ph email can contribute reports, while everyone can view real-time updates.
- UPDATE (as of Nov. 2025): HII, Marco here! I can't really focus on it right now because of school work, but I will start on it once the semester ends 😄😄😄
